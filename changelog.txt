Entry: Shop Basket System, Login Requirement, Homepage Alignment, and UI/UX Improvements
Date: 2025-10-30T00:00:00Z

Highlights:
- Implemented fully functional basket (cart) system on shop page:

Entry: Admin page fixes and static asset routing updates
Date: 2025-10-08T22:20:00Z

Summary:
- Fixed admin template name mismatch and asset 404s when loading `/admin/logs`.
- Ensured header image paths work under any route (including `/admin/...`).
- Added explicit routes to serve `js`, `images`, and `fonts` (including Poppins from `Templates/fonts`).
- Removed invalid SRI attributes that were blocking CDN scripts.

Changed Files:
- Modified: Controllers/adminController.py
  - Render `admin_logs.html` instead of non-existent `admin_log.html`.

- Modified: Templates/header.html
  - Use `url_for('static', ...)` for `images/lf2.png` and `images/menu.png`.

- Modified: app.py
  - Added routes: `/js/<path>`, `/images/<path>`, `/fonts/<path>`.
  - Fonts route serves from `Templates/fonts` with fallback to root `fonts/`.

- Modified: Templates/scripts.html
  - Removed `integrity` attributes on CDN `<script>` tags to prevent blocking.

Follow-up Notes:
- If you host assets behind a CDN with SRI, re-add integrity hashes that match the exact CDN files used.
- If further 404s appear, confirm the requested path matches an existing file under `images/`, `js/`, `Templates/fonts/`, or `fonts/`.

Entry: JWT carried via HttpOnly cookies; profile page integration fixed
Date: 2025-10-13T00:00:00Z

Summary:
- Set access and refresh tokens as HttpOnly cookies on login and refresh for seamless navigation to protected views.
- Updated auth middleware to accept JWT from Authorization header or cookies.
- Fixed `Templates/profile.html` to call unified `/me` endpoint and use `/uploads/<filename>` for profile photos.

Changed Files:
- Modified: Controllers/authController.py
  - Return response using `make_response` and set `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies.
  - On `/refresh`, set updated `access_token` cookie.

- Modified: Utils/auth_decorator.py
  - Read token from `Authorization` header or fallback to `access_token` cookie.

- Modified: Templates/profile.html
  - Fetch user via `/me` with `credentials: "include"` and correct image path to `/uploads/<filename>`.

Notes:
- Cookies are set with `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`. Set `secure=True` in production over HTTPS.
